          <h2>Correlations Observed Between Poverty, Age, Income and Healthcare, Smoking and Obesity</h2>
          <p>For Age and Healthcare it appears that states in the south have more individuals without healthcare than states in the north,
            which is surprising given the lack of public transportation in the south. For Age and Smokers there seems to be an even spread
            of people in their 30's who are smokers across all states.  Finally for Age and Obesity there is a similar clustering of 
            obese people to those who smoke across all states east, west, north and south.
          </p>

          <p>No surprise that when it comes to Poverty the less available resources there are the more apt individuals are to being
            obese, have no access to healthcare and are smokers.
          </p>

          <p>Again no surprise that as it relates to income the higher the income the lower the obesity and smoker percentage. 
            Northern states where the incomes tend to be higher have lower obesity and smoker levels relative to their southern
            counterparts.  What was surprising was there was no correlation between income and lack of healthcare in northern states
            perhaps because individuals in those states tend to be more active or because there cost of living is higher they can't 
            afford coverage?  For those in southern states where incomes tend to be less the healthcare coverage is higher probably 
            because of the availability to public healthcare such as medicaid.
